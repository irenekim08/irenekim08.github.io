Title: Day 1
---

In class today, I created my GitHub portfolio and discussed factors of a good reflection post as a group:
- Progress (what work I did)
- How it changed my project (Did it work well?)
- Problems
- Emotions
- Connections (to other experiences)
- Future steps



I also established an outline of my project:

Problem:
Grant applicants are getting denied because their requests do not fit the purpose for the applied grant.

Solution:
A code that analyzes a Google Form to guide a grant requester to their best-fit grant form.

Parts of the form:
- Association with Uni (student or faculty)
- A multiple choice question about the purpose for the money
- Requested amount
(After submission)
- Best match(es) for grants to apply for and their links
- Who to contact for additional help

Things to think about:
- What grants are out there and still being funded?
- What if there are changes to available grants in the future?
- What if the application is asking for an amount exceeding the best-fit grant's revenue?
- How can the program be implemented to be accessible for all grant applicants?
- Does using Google Forms impact memory/storage?
