Title: Day 8
---

(Over the weekend, I talked to my dad about the load error I encountered and my solution of rebooting the app. He said it didn't seem like a caching problem, and that it was probably an error from Streamlit.)

During 5th period today, I had an extremely stressful session of debugging.
My main goals were to:
1. 
2. Resolve the key error type B that kept arising
3. Remove multiplicity when generating results
