Title: Day 8
---

(Over the weekend, I talked to my dad about the load error I encountered and my solution of rebooting the app. He said it didn't seem like a caching problem, and that it was probably an error from Streamlit.)

During 5th period today, I had an extremely stressful session of debugging.
My main goals were to:
1. Get rid of error that arises when no pill-buttons are selected
2. Resolve the key error type B that kept arising
3. Remove multiplicity when generating results

My goal #1 was achieved easily by adding in an if statement to only start the generate_results function once a pill is selected.

Goal #2 was a HUGE, LONG struggle. By adding in st.write statements here and there to check if parts of my code resulted in strings or lists, I found out that the key error type B was outputted due to the code attempting to find value(s) for a key "B," when it was non-existent.
