Title: Day 1 (Beyond)
---

Ok. I made a functioning, up-to-date online app that can help grant applicants at Uni find their best-fit grants.
But let's be real now. Other than whoever asks me for the link, the Uni High Grant Matcher cannot reach its intended audience. The program itself works, but it hasn't reached its purpose. 

I talked to Ms. H after the usual SFAC meeting to let her know about my creation. We then navigated to Dr. E in the office and got a sign of approval. Later, I sent an email to Ms. H with the link to the program, as well as steps on how to use it, adding to the end my interest in continuing the project with feedback.
She hasn't gotten back to me, but I know she has been busy with the new policy.

Note for self:
The app has been going to sleep (I think maybe more frequently than before).
