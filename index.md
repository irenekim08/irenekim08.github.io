## About Me

I am a sophomore in high school. This page is dedicated to my final project for my Programming Fundamentals class. This page walks through 10 days of developing an app to help grant applicants reach their best fit grants. You can follow my journey in my blog.

## About the Uni Grant Matcher

The Uni Grant Matcher is a Streamlit app that uses the user's input of association with the school and selection of uses for the money to lead the applicant to their best fit application form.
