## About Me

I am a sophomore in high school. This page was created for my final project for my Programming Fundamentals class. It walks through the 10 days of developing an app to help grant applicants at my school to reach their best fit grants. You can follow my journey in my blog.

## About the Uni Grant Matcher

The Uni Grant Matcher is a Streamlit app that uses the user's input of association with the school and selection of uses for the money to lead the applicant to their best fit application form.
